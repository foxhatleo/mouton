Aang is a powerful AI assistant system designed for the Circolo Kiosk,
built on ChatGPT and HeyGen technology. It enables clients to craft
personalized avatars and custom prompts, creating an interactive experience
where customers can simply approach the kiosk and ask questions to their
chosen avatar. The system offers a seamless, intuitive interaction that feels
natural and engaging.

What truly distinguishes Aang is its high level of customization. With just
a short 2-minute video of a team member speaking, clients can create avatars
that capture the energy and personality of a real person, offering a genuine
and lifelike experience instead of a generic animation or robotic interaction.

One notable implementation is at a nearby hospital, where doctors and medical
staff serve as avatars on multiple kiosks. Here, Aang assists with basic
triaging and addresses minor health inquiries, receiving positive feedback
from both patients and stakeholders. While the source code is private,
a [demo](https://avatar.circolo.us/go) is
publicly available for anyone interested in exploring its capabilities.
