Throughout the course of 2020, I served as a volunteer within the project
team dedicated to the enhancement of Cornell University’s Course
Management System X (CMSX). This system is ubiquitously utilized by
students and faculty of the Computer and Information Science department
for academic tasks including assignments, quizzes, and surveys. Notably,
it facilitates integration with autograders, plagiarism detection tools,
and course management instruments.


However, given that the system had been in operation for over two decades,
its user interface began to exhibit signs of obsolescence. Both students
and faculty reported that the aesthetics were outdated, and more
importantly, the platform was ill-suited for usage on mobile devices due
to its original design specifications. Consequently, I joined forces with
the frontend division to undertake a comprehensive redesign of the entire
frontend, placing particular emphasis on responsive design. To facilitate
a swift and contemporary development process, we elected to utilize React
and Redux.


My responsibilities entailed the development of several user interface
components. Throughout the design process, I rigorously tested each
iteration on a mobile device to ascertain optimal functionality.
Additionally, I facilitated usability testing with fellow department
members, acquiring invaluable feedback to enhance the website’s
intuitiveness.


Upon completion of the frontend redesign in the fall semester of 2020, we
began a phased release to the department. We were met with an overwhelming
positive response, with accolades for the redesigned frontend’s enhanced
intuitiveness and ease of use. The impact of this project continues to be
evident to this day.


Regrettably, due to the nature of this project, the source code is not
available for review.
