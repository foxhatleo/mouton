Welcome! I’m Leo, an ambitious software engineer currently at
[Sigma Computing](https://sigmacomputing.com).
I graduated from [Cornell](https://cornell.edu)
with a Master’s in Computer Science in 2023, and have been working in the field
of software engineering since then.
I’m eager to contribute my skills and expertise to a dynamic team,
with a firm belief in using technology
to improve and enrich lives.

Born in China and fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, and English, I revel in embracing diverse cultures. I’m currently on
an exciting journey learning Japanese and French, further extending my linguistic capabilities.

When I’m not immersed in coding or languages, I find solace in playing the piano and exploring the world. Thank you
for visiting my website — enjoy discovering more about my passions and pursuits.
